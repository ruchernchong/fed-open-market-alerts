## API Integration

The application fetches data from the New York Federal Reserve Open Market Operations API:

- **Base URL**: `https://markets.newyorkfed.org/api/rp/reverserepo/all/results`
- **Primary Endpoint**: `/lastTwoWeeks.json`
- **Data Handling**: TanStack Query with automatic caching and error handling

## Chrome Extension

The project includes Chrome extension support with automated notifications and user management:

- **Manifest**: V3 extension defined in `manifest.config.ts`
- **Permissions**: Access to `markets.newyorkfed.org`, localhost, and notifications
- **Popup Dashboard**: Dedicated `popup.tsx` component with market data and settings access
- **User Preferences**: Configurable settings via `src/components/settings/view.tsx` component
- **Notification Badges**: Visual indicators for unread notifications on extension icon
- **Background Worker**: Handles scheduled data checks and notifications
- **Smart Notifications**: Only alerts when new operations are published, scheduled weekdays at 1:20 PM EST

### Extension Features

- **Popup Dashboard**: Interactive dashboard showing market data directly in extension popup
- **User Preferences**: Settings interface for customizing notification preferences
- **Badge Notifications**: Unread notification count displayed on extension icon
- **Automated Monitoring**: Background service checks for new Fed operations on weekdays
- **Push Notifications**: Chrome native notifications when new operations are published
- **Data Persistence**: Tracks operation timestamps to prevent duplicate alerts
- **Manual Triggers**: Support for on-demand operation checks via extension messaging

To load the extension in development:

1. Run `bun run build`
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode"
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist` folder

## Development Patterns

### Component Architecture

- **Multi-Page Application**: React Router with distinct pages:
    - Landing page (`/`) with features overview and latest data preview
    - Dashboard page (`/dashboard`) with full market data and trends
    - Extension redirect page (`/extension`) for Chrome Web Store
- **SEO Integration**: React Helmet Async for dynamic page titles and meta tags
- **Data Fetching**: Components use TanStack Query hooks for API integration
- **UI Patterns**: Loading states handled with reusable `<Loader>` components
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling with `<Alert>` components
- **Shared Components**: Metric cards and data tables follow established patterns
- **Chrome Extension**: Popup (`popup.tsx`) provides dashboard with market data and settings access
- **Settings Management**: Dedicated `src/components/settings/view.tsx` component with preference controls

### Code Quality

- Strict TypeScript configuration with path aliasing (`@/` for src)
- Biome for consistent linting and formatting
- Double quotes and space indentation
- Automatic import organization

## Build Process

The build creates both web and extension builds:

1. TypeScript compilation (`tsc -b`)
2. Vite build with React and Tailwind plugins
3. Chrome extension manifest generation

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Common Types:**

- `feat:` - New features (triggers minor version bump)
- `fix:` - Bug fixes (triggers patch version bump)
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring without feature changes
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks, dependency updates
- `ci:` - CI/CD configuration changes

**Examples:**

```bash
feat(reverse-repo): add real-time data updates
fix(charts): resolve tooltip positioning issue
docs: update README installation guide
chore(deps): update react to v19.1.2
```

### Development Guidelines

1. Follow the existing code patterns and conventions
2. Use the established component structure
3. Ensure TypeScript types are properly defined
4. Write commit messages following conventional commit format
5. Run `bun run lint` before committing
6. Test both web and extension builds

### Release Process

- **Automated Releases**: Triggered on push to main branch via GitHub Actions
- **Prerelease Versions**: Main branch produces beta versions (e.g., `1.0.0-beta.1`)
- **Version Control**: Managed by semantic-release based on commit messages
